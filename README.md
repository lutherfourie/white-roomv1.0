# The White Room

**The White Room** is a procedural spatial interface designed to bridge the gap between imagination and visualization. It acts as a limitless staging ground where users initiate "Creation Protocols" to generate immersive worlds.

## Core Concepts

- **The Interface**: A minimalist, void-like environment that removes distraction, focusing entirely on the user's creative intent.
- **The Core**: A reactive sphere that processes voice and gaze input, translating raw intent into data.
- **The Array**: A circular formation of massive monoliths. These structures act as anchors for the portal technology. When a creation is generated, the energetic field between these obelisks stabilizes, forming a panoramic gateway to the new reality.

## Technical Features

- **Procedural Shaders**: Custom GLSL implementations for volumetric nebulae, stable star fields, and reactive energy surfaces.
- **Scale**: The environment is designed to convey a sense of vastness, with structures towering over the user to emphasize the magnitude of the worlds being created.
- **Reaction**: The environment responds to audio input and gaze pressure, creating a tactile connection between the user and the system.

## Experience Flow

1. **Initialize**: User enters the White Room.
2. **Input**: User gazes at the Core and speaks their intent (e.g., "A cyberpunk city in the rain").
3. **Ignition**: The Core processes the data, transmitting the sequence to The Array.
4. **Transition**: The obelisks surge with power, energizing the space between them. A 360-degree portal curtain materializes, immersing the user in the generated world.
